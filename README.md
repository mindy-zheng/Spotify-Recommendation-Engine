# Spotify-Recommendation-Engine
A recommendation engine for music lovers. 

When I first began coding, I made a mini-project to explore manipulating data and utilizing Spotify's API to present my favorite songs onto a webpage. Albeit simple in theory, I was immensely proud of my application. 

As a musician, I'm always eager to find new songs. This is why the Spotify's recommendation system has always intrigued me. In my personal opinion, this is the best usage of personalizing an experience through technology and machine learning concepts. I decided I wanted to (attempt...) build a replica of this system.
